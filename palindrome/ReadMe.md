## Problem Statement
Given a string, write a python function to check if it is palindrome or not. A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string. For example, “radar” is a palindrome, but “radix” is not a palindrome.

## Example
```
Input : malayalam
Output : Yes

Input : geeks
Output : No
```

## Thought Process/ Notes to get started
- Write modular code with helper
- Write driver code. This could be a shell script
- Write test cases


## How to run the code
```
python3 palindrome.py -w [word]
```

You may also use the shell script to run the code but will have to provide the word in the script itself
```
./start.sh
```
